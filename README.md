# Interactive Biostatistics Workshop: Intro to R Programming & Biostatistics Primer

###### Overview: 
In order to make the most out of our time together in November, we are asking participants to complete a pre-course to familiarize themselves with R programming language, the RStudio environment and basic biostatistical concepts.  

###### Course Objectives: 	
By the end of this self-directed pre-course participants should: 
-	Be familiar with the RStudio environment
-	Be able to read in data and interact with it
-	Be able to produce summary statistics and simple figures

###### Instructions:
-	**Each topic links to an instructional video on YouTube. Watch each video** (they are short at ~5 mins each) and follow along. You can enable closed captions at the bottom of the video, if you would like.
-	**Complete** the corresponding exercise. Be sure to save and annotate your R program!
- **Download** the Rosmap dataset and corresponding files. This is the dataset that we will be using throughout the primer.
-	**Follow the topics in order**, as they build on each other.
-	**Upload** your final R program with answers to all the exercises **in a single document** (not multiple programs).
