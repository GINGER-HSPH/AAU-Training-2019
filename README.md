# Welcome to the Homepage for the Interactive Biostatistics Workshop


**Addis Ababa University**

**Addis Ababa, Ethiopia**

18-22 November 2019


On behalf of the Department of Psychiatry and the Global Initiative for Neuropsychiatric Genetics Education in Research (GINGER), we are pleased to welcome you to this training program. The aim of this training is to ensure attendees gain the fundamental skills and concepts in biostatistics needed to pursue individual research projects. We also aim to inspire individuals to pursue research careers and to encourage research collaboration. 


The training is run by the GINGER program, in collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry at Addis Ababa University. GINGER is a collaborative research education program established by a grant to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health from the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, MA, USA. The GINGER program, at the intersection of clinical neuroscience and mental health, aims to address the global gap in neuropsychiatric genetics research by enhancing genetic research capacity through training and mentoring of early-career researchers. To this end, GINGER partners with research and academic institutions to develop research skills- trainings located in countries where mental health research is growing. 


Neuropsychiatric genetics research is multi-disciplinary, spanning the fields of epidemiology, biostatistics, neuroscience, genetics, and bioethics, and relies on collaboration not only to conduct research but to adequately train a new cadre of international researchers in this field. The GINGER Program, along with the Department of Psychiatry at AAU, hopes to inspire students and professionals to pursue research careers, and to build new research partnerships through the exchange of ideas. We hope this training provides you with skill sets to support your research activities and introduces you to new ideas, as well as individuals you can collaborate with.
